# Web Development Lab 3 - *â˜• On My Grind*

Submitted by: **Michael Morriss**

This web app: **Overview
Have you ever wanted to work at Starbucks? Youâ€™re about to be one step closer. In this app inspired by Wordle, memorize coffee drink recipes and quiz yourself on a random real (and possibly discontinued ðŸ˜‰) Starbucks drinkâ€™s temperature, flavor, milk type, and blendedness. The app will let you know if youâ€™re a natural at barista-ing.

Required Features
Quiz, quiz, quiz! In the required features for this project, you will have a form with multiple choice inputs that can be selected and their values will populate the answer box above them. Then when submitted, the answer boxes will turn red if the answers placed there are incorrect and purple if the answers are correct. Can you handle the Starbucks drink station at an 8 am rush?

Stretch Features
In the stretch goals, we are making it a little harder by having users have to guess our four ingredients for each drink and type in their answer. Of course this means that they cannot just type in anything, their guesses still have to be in line with what options we have given for the 4 categories. How can we enforce that?
